<h1><p>QRP Tips</p></h1>

<p>I’m an avid QRP operator—here are some hints I’ve learned over the years:</p>

<h2><p>Start with at Least a Decent Antenna</p></h2>
<p>QRP with a bad antenna is no fun at all! I’d say a dipole or vertical is the minimum. But don’t get me wrong—I’ve been using just a G5RV for the last two years, and <a href="10m.html">here’s<a/> what I’ve managed to do on 28 MHz!</p>

<h2><p>Listen, Listen… and Then Call CQ</p></h2>
<p>Of course, always listen carefully. But don’t be afraid to call CQ—especially on CW and digital modes.</p>

<h2><p>Compete with Yourself</p></h2>
<p>You’ll see some suspiciously high scores in QRP categories from time to time. Sure, it is possible to outscore LP stations with smart operating technique and good antennas. But remember—there are physical limits to what 5 W can do. Take pride in your personal bests, not just rankings.</p>

<h2><p>Explore Different Strategies</p></h2>
<p>QRP can be frustrating—even when conditions are good. If you’re struggling to make a QSO, try something different: call CQ on 40 m around noon, switch to 10 m for sporadic E, or look for openings on lesser-used bands. Stay flexible and creative.</p>

<h2><p>Don’t Push It (or Do—Just Remember It’s All for Fun)</p></h2>
<p>When conditions are bad, QRP contesting or DXing can be really frustrating. Sometimes the best move is to take a break: build something, go for a walk, play some music, read a book. Try again in an hour.</p>

<p>On the other hand—if you do push through rough conditions, you might actually gain a tactical advantage. Many OMs shut down when the bands are poor. If you’re still on, you may snag some rare QSOs. Just remember: don't let yourself get frustrated.</p>

<h2><p>Above all: have fun!</p></h2>
