	<h1>FT8 Tips (Not Only for QRP)</h1>
	
	<h2>1) Listen, listen, listen!</h2>
<p>The golden rule of DXing—whether you're running QRO as a big gun or pushing the limits with QRPp. Before calling, take time to observe the band activity and understand the rhythm.</p>
	<h2>2) Archive your received data.</h2>
<p>This is your toolkit for improving. Keep logs to evaluate your antennas, analyze your operating times, rethink contest strategies, and study how solar activity affects propagation. Your waterfall and PSKreporter history can be valuable sources of insight.</p>
	
	<h2>3) Enable data sharing with PSKreporter.</h2>
Support the community—or at the very least, let others know what you're hearing. It helps everyone and builds a better picture of global propagation.

<h2>4) Work split—most of the time.</h2>
<p>In general, it's better to call a station using split mode (i.e., not on their exact TX frequency). If the CQing station isn't overloaded and comes from a common location, calling on their frequency may work. But when the band is crowded, and you can assume the station you are chasing will have a lot of callers, it's usually smarter to call off-frequency.</p>
<p>If the band is super crowded, you can guess that they are listening or the clear spot, and the rest of the band could be busy, In such a conditions, it could be better to call on their frequency. This is particularly true during intense openings on 50 MHz or 144 MHz—where many stations transmit simultaneously and the band can become chaotic.</p>

<h2>5) Think twice when the bands are crowded.</h2>
<p>FT8 is fantastic—but let’s admit one thing: it doesn't handle <i>very</i> good propagation well. When a major opening happens, the 3 kHz FT8 window can get saturated quickly. Even with great conditions, you may find it hard to complete a QSO just because the band is full.</p>
<p>In such situations:</p>

    <p>Switch to FT4 (faster, slightly narrower)</p>

    <p>Try CW or SSB</p>

    <p>Move to another band</p>

    <p>Or just keep trying—timing is everything!</p>

<h2>6) Be mindful of band edges and filter limitations.</h2>
<p>Some stations operate at the extreme low/high ends of the FT8 passband (e.g., below 500 Hz or above 2500 Hz). Remember, not everyone has an SDR with adjustable filters. Many hams use older rigs with fixed crystal filters, which may not cover the entire FT8 range. Expensive transceivers are a luxury—not a necessity. With a second-hand or DIY rig and simple antennas, you can still enjoy a world of radio fun.
If you're not getting responses, try moving your TX offset between 500 Hz and 2200 Hz. Use “Fake It” or “Split” mode in WSJT-X to transmit off-center more effectively.</p>
