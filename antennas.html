	<h1>Antennas</h1>
	
	<a href="http://www.popular-hifi.com/shack/ant_g5rv/g5rv.pdf"<p><b>G5RV</b></a> A classic multiband setup—but remember, you should never tune an antenna through the coaxial cable. The tuner should always be placed between the twin-lead and the coax.
Here’s my configuration:  2×15 m inverted-V dipole → 10 m of 300-ohm TV ladder line through the attic → N7DDC autotuner → choke balun.

A great idea from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120716095019/http://www.w5dxp.com/notuner.htm">W5DXP</a> is to adjust the tuning by changing the ladder line length. You can basically use any dipole length—I’ve had great results with 2×17 m and even 2×40 m. </p>

	<a href="https://www.kk5jy.net/three-wire-gp/"><p><b>GP Vertical</b></a> Another classic. Many people underestimate verticals compared to dipoles or beams, but they’re excellent antennas—as long as you understand what to expect: no gain, but a low radiation angle, which is great for DX.
More radials = more fun. But even with just two, you can make plenty of DX contacts.

I like the multiband fan configuration—just run the wires in parallel. Don’t overdo it though, or you might run into unwanted resonances. From my experience, 20 m / 15 m / 10 m works fine.</p>

	<p><b>Inverted L</b> A solid starting point for serious work on 160 m and 80 m. Again: more radials = better performance.
I also had good results using a fan configuration, with parallel wires for different bands. </p>

	<a href="https://moxonantennaproject.net/"><p><b>Moxon</b></a> Small but efficient. I built one for 10 m back in 2014 using wire and some old junk. Mounted it on wooden poles, about 4 m AGL. Boom—first contact was a VU station on SSB with 5 W.
Do I need to say more? </p>

	<a href="https://www.qsl.net/dk7zb/PVC-Yagis/PVC-details.htm"><p><b>144 MHz 6 element Yagi</b></a> An ultralight beam from DK7ZB. No problem making 600 km contacts with QRP—assuming a decent location, of course. </p>
